      "Synthesis of (2Z,2′Z)-2,2′-(1,4-Phenylene)bis(3-(furan-2-yl)-acrylonitrile) (PBFA). Furfural (0.1 mL, 1.206 mmol, 1 equiv) and 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile (0.16 g, 0.603 mmol, 0.5 equiv) were dissolved in 10 mL of methanol and heated in a microwave reactor (150 W) until 65 °C. Then, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (0.78 mL, 1.206 mmol, 1 equiv) was carefully added to the medium. The solution was subjected to microwave radiation at 65 °C with a power of 150 W during 1 h. The reaction kinetics were monitored by collecting aliquots from the crude reaction mixture at different time intervals and analyzing them by 1H NMR in deuterated chloroform. A yellow solid was obtained and filtered using a Büchner funnel. The synthesized product was washed and recrystallized with methanol. Before the characterization, the solid product was dried under vacuum overnight (yield = 86%). For the conventional synthesis, furfural and 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile were added in the same quantities as for the microwave synthesis in methanol in a 100 mL Schlenk flask. The mixture was heated to 65 °C, after which tetrabutylammonium hydroxide was carefully added. The reaction was maintained at 65 °C for 6 h (yield = 75%). Liquid 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the samples were recorded at 298 K using a 400 MHz Bruker Avance NMR in CDCl3; 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.71 ppm (dd, 2H, Har), 7.64 ppm (dd, 2H, −O−CH), 7.45 ppm (s, 2H, −CH═C−CN), 7.25 ppm (dd, 4H, −C═CH−CH), 6.61 ppm (dd, 2H, −CH═CH−CH). HRMS calculated for C20H12N2O2: 312.33 gmol−1, found 312.089341 gmol−1 (Figures S7 and S11)."

      "Electropolymerization of P(PBFA) and P(PBFT). To assess the electropolymerization potential of the precursors, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted using a VersaSTAT3 potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research). CV data were collected in a solution containing 0.1 M LiTFSI in anhydrous acetonitrile employing a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 ranging from 0 to +1.5 V vs Ag/AgCl. The experiments utilized a three-electrode setup, comprising an ITO (VisionTek Systems Ltd, 15 mm × 15 mm × 0.2 sq−1) substrate as the working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode in 3 mol L−1 KCl as the reference electrode. Prior to each electrochemical test, the working electrode surface was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using several solvents, 10 min each, 10 min in a 4% solution of Hellmanex basic soap, followed by three cycles of 5 min in distilled water, and finally 10 min in isopropanol."

    "Procedure": [
      "Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices were fabricated using a direct architecture: glass/ITO/P(PBFA)/P(Q10:Y6/Ca/Al. ITO-coated glass substrates (1.5 × 1.5 cm; 10 Ω/sq, VisionTek) were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic baths in detergent, deionized water, and isopropanol. The hole transport layer, P(PBFA), was deposited by electropolymerization via 1 or 2 cyclic voltammetry cycles, following the previously described procedure. The resulting films were thermally annealed in air at 100 °C for 10 min. The active layer solution was prepared by dissolving a P(Q10:Y6 blend (weight ratio 1:1.2, total concentration 20 mg mL−1) in dry chloroform and stirring overnight at 55 °C in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The solution was then filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter and spin-coated (35 μL, 3000 rpm, 60 s) onto the P(PBFA) layer. A second thermal annealing step was performed at 100 °C for 10 min. Finally, calcium (20 nm) and aluminum (100 nm) electrodes were thermally evaporated under high vacuum (P = 10−6 mbar). The active area of the OPV devices was 10.5 mm2."
